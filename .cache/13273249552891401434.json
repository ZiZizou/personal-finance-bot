            <description>After an 84% rally in 2025, the shares are near their highest level in two years, recovering from a 60% drop in 2024 when Intel appeared to be falling behind its rivals who were capitalizing on the AI boom.  “It’s back from the dead,” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners and a long-time Intel shareholder.  A range of catalysts are driving the optimism: an improving financial outlook, new confidence from Wall Street as seen in recent analyst upgrades, speculation about new foundry customers, and even enthusiasm around the company’s potential to be a winner in President Trump’s “America First” campaign.</description>

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said the company will try to accelerate the transfer of its advanced chipmaking expertise to the US in the future, though it will still develop and maintain its most cutting-edge fabrication techniques at home.
